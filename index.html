        <h2>Here I am</h2>
            <p style="font-size:20px;"> 
            Hello. My name is bW and I am embarking on a new professional
            endeavor - software develpment, specifically related to
            analytics and interactive data visualization for financial,
            engineering and scientific organizations. Yeh, I know it's
            a really specific objective, but I'm leveraging a former 
            professional life in quantitative and financial analysis.
            </p>
    
        <h2>Kansas</h2>
        <figure>
        <img src="images/Osawatomie.jpg" width="500" heigth="400">
        <figcaption>Flint Hills Trail in Osawatomie, Kansas.</figcaption>
        </figure>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
            At my core, I am a country boy from Kansas - a proud son
            of Osawatomie (a town of about 2,500 and maybe 5 stop 
            lights). It was here that I was molded with Midwestern
            values and developed an 'uninformed' interest in finance 
            and banking simply because the father of my best friend 
            was president of the local bank.
            </p>

        <h2>Chicago</h2>
        <figure>
        <img src="images/Chicago.jpg" width="600" heigth="400">
        <figcaption>Chicago skyline</figcaption>
        </figure>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
            I suppose I was destined for big things because my parents 
            decided to relocate to Chicago, IL during my first year of 
            high school. Can you say "culture shock"! Well, I grew to love
            the "Windy City", the "City of Big Shoulders", Chi-town". I even
            became a die-hard Cubs fan.
            </p>

        <h2>New York City and Beyond</h2>
        <figure>
        <img src="images/NYC-LowerManhattan.jpg" width="600" heigth="400">
        <figcaption>New York City - Lower Manhattan</figcaption>
        </figure>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
              Having made the adjustment to Chicago, I decided that there
              was more of the world to see. So after graduating from college
              I thought I would go big again and relocated to New York
              City to take a job on Wall Street. Beyond my grunt job as a
              newbie 'sweat-dog' financial analyst, it was a period of fun and 
              exploration that took me to California, back to Chicago twice and 
              travels around the world. Most importantly, my work in finance was 
              a key factor in my abiding interest in technology which had become 
              integral to my work. In fact, the CEO of my company would often 
              state that JPMorgan Chase was a technology company masquerading as a 
              financial services organization.
            </p>

        <h2>Time for a Change, in Pursuit of a Passion</h2>
        <figure>
        <img src="images/DataAnalytics2.jpg" width="600" heigth="300">
        <figcaption>Analytics and Data Visualization</figcaption> 
        </figure>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
              Eventually the big lights and fast life of the big city began to 
              wear on me, and I yearned for the simpler existance of my 
              Midwestern roots. I was ready for a change that would allow me to
              itch the technology bug while leveraging my quantitative DNA  
              and skillset. A series of mostly fortunate events took me to Chicago (again) 
              and then to St. Louis. I landed in a role as the business manager of 
              an engineering firm, which primarilly entails developing a finance 
              function and data analytics capability. (Engineering firms generate 
              lots and lots of data in many disparate forms). This is my current 
              challenge, requiring that I up my software development game rather than
              rely on 'off-the-shelf' solutions. Be careful what you ask for...
            </p>

        <h2>There is Balance</h2>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
              While I am intensely focused on building a foundation my budding software 
              development career, I do have other interests that provide balance. As a 
              native country boy, I am an adventurous outdoorsman. I very much enjoy and 
              engage in any activity related to water and mountains. Kayaking is a favorite, 
              and I spend many days each year in the Smoky or Rocky mountain regions. I am 
              also an avid golfer, but I golf moreso for the serenitiy that comes with 
              walking a beautifully designed and manicured course that seamlessly integrates 
              the natural surroundings of the course.
